Particle Effects:

- The Main Particle Module was edited to shorten the lifetime and start speed
- The Emission Particle was edited to slow down the rate of the particles
- The Shape Module was edited to give the particle a cone shape and a wider angle
- Color over lifetime and speed were edited to give the particle a fun gradient 
- Size over Lifetime was edited to make the particle shrink and grow while its cycle ran 
- Texture Sheet Animation was edited to replace the particles with a custom sprite
- Texture sheet animation was also used to make the sprite spin while running its cycle
- The Tails module was used to create a spooky ribbon that complimented the sprial animation

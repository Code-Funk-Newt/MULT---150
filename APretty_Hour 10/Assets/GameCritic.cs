Game Critic: "Improving the Game"

Q1) Is the game too easy or hard? 
A1)I think the game is somewhere inbetween if Im being honest.An easy part of the game is that some of the goals might solve themselves even if you arent
moving the bumper around. A difficult part of the game is that the choas balls seem to be moving too quick. 

Q2)What would make it easier or harder? 
A2) I think the speed of the choas balls could be reduced. Maybe the colors need to be readjusted as well. The orange and the red were hard to see in the 
blur of the bright yellow choas balls. Maybe if there was a way for the color ball to track the last thing it hit before it hits its goal marker the game would
be an actual challenge for the player. I also think that would provide more incentive for the player to move around. Speed of the player could be adjusted a little
bit higher.

Q3) What would give it a "wow" facor? 
A3) I think the wow factor would all come down to style. The game is fun but the backgrounds are bland and not vivid. Think the style of the setting could improve. 
I think catchy music would be fun too. 

Q4) What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious? 
A4) I think the game is fun especially when you are able to hit the ball. I think the speed at which the player moves at is tedious when considering the fast choas
balls whizzing around you. 


Implemented suggestions from the book:
- I added a clock that counts the run time of the game. 
- I added a chaos ball goal that is competing against the player. The player is supposed to play as a goalie at the chaos ball goal.
The objective is for the player to gettthe colored balls in their goals before the all the choas balls score their goal.  
- I changed the shape of the bumper for more control. The angles allow for more precision. 
- I changed the texture of the bumper to give it an old timely boardgame feel.
- I added water sounds while walking from a unity free asset online.

Game Critic for Hour 20:

Q1)Is the game too easy or hard ?
A1) I think that the fact the character moves a bit slow makes things difficult. I feel 
like I am dragged down while controlling them. I also think the camera location is a 
bit awkward and makes it hard to anticipate upcoming obstacles. I think think thing 
the game is hard, I think think its a little janky. 

Q2) What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
A2) I think making the character move faster and the adjusting the camera angle would make 
things a whole lot easier. I would also like to change the time counting method. I would 
like to collect more time so then it builds up. Maybe have vairous powerups with different
times. It would make things eaiser, instead of the time method thats currently in use now. 

Q3)List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor?
A3)I find that the theme and style of the game is sorta of boring, typical from a video game.
If Im answering on a personal bais, I love to see a aquatic theme implimented. Maybe the 
character could be a jetskiier and the obstacles could be puffer fish. 

Q3)What 2 parts of the game are fun? 
A3) I think the randomization and rate of spawn of the obstacles is fun. It does not treat 
the player dumb. I think that you could Phase Out is a fun option, if the player wants to get 
a bit tricky with their play style. 

Q4)What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
A4) I think the speed of the player is very tedious. This could be worked on. I also dislike the 
camera angle. I think the timer is tedious as well. Why cant I collect more time?
